        <h1>Senior Lecturer</h1>
        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
		
			<li>Parameterized/multivariate (FPT) algorithms and algorithmic methods - Multivariate algorithms offer solutions to many problem that are intractable using the conventional algorithmic paradigm. Multivariate algorithmic techniques have so far proven useful in areas such as bioinformatics. Applications for FPT algorithms of particular interest are econometrics and analysis of social networking.</li>
			<li>Predictive analytics and data mining - Predictive analytics combines business intelligence with recent statistical techniques. This research combines this with recent advances in clustering and pattern searching using FPT techniques.</li>
			<li>Infectious disease control using mobile phone technology and cryptographic techniques Combinatorial Algorithms</li>
