        <h3>Parameterized Complexity</h3>
        <p>
            Parameterized Complexity is a recent branch of computational complexity theory that provides
            a framework for a refined analysis of hard algorithmic problems. The big, important problems
            facing Planet Earth have structure with “secondary” measurements (parameters), apart from 
            the primary measurement of overall input size that significantly affect problem computational 
            complexity.
            The central notion of fixed parameter tractability (FPT) is a generalization of polynomial-time 
            based on confining any non-polynomial (typically exponential) complexity costs to a function 
            only of these secondary measurements

        <h3>Who We are ?</h3>
        <p>
            The Parameterized Complexity Research Unit is an independent research unit in the Charles Darwin
            University. Established in 2012,PCRU interacts with a broad international research community 
            and undertakes research that is strongly interdisciplinary.

         <h3>Multivariate Algorithmics</h3>
         <p>
           The big, important problems facing Planet Earth have structure with secondary measurements (parameters),
           apart from the primary measurement of overall input size, that significantly affect problem computational
           complexity.Parameterized Complexity is a recent branch of computational complexity theory that provides a 
           framework for a refined analysis of hard algorithmic problems.The multivariate approach allows more realistic 
           modelling of real-world input distributions.
