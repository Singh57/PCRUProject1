         <h3>Parameterized Complexity</h3>
         <p>
        Welcome to PCRU! The Parameterized Complexity Research Unit interacts with a broad international research community and undertakes research that is strongly interdisciplinary.

What is Parameterized Complexity?

Parameterized Complexity is a recent branch of computational complexity theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis of hard algorithmic problems. The big, important problems facing Planet Earth have structure
with “secondary” measurements (parameters), apart from the primary measurement of overall input size, that significantly affect problem computational complexity.
<br><br>
The central notion of fixed parameter tractability (FPT) is a generalization of polynomial-time based on confining any non-polynomial (typically exponential) complexity costs to a function only of these secondary measurements.
Parameterized algorithms have strong connections to heuristics for NP-hard problems, and the multivariate approach allows more realistic modelling of real-world input distributions.
<br><br>
The field is strongly interdisciplinary, with
applications in massive parallel processing of huge data sets, bioinformatics, AI, computational social choice, ecology and other disciplines.or a refined analysis of hard algorithmic problems.
The multivariate approach allows more realistic  modelling of real-world input distributions.
