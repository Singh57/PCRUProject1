           <p>The Parameterized Complexity Research Unit is an independant research unit in the Charles Darwin University. Established in 2012, PCRu interacts with a broad international research
community and undertakes research that is strongly interdisciplinary.</p>
<h3>Key Research Themes</h3>
<h5>Multivariate Algorithmics</h5>
<p>The big, important problems facing Planet Earth have structure with “secondary”
measurements (parameters), apart from the primary measurement of overall input size, that
significantly affect problem computational complexity. Parameterized Complexity is a recent
branch of computational complexity theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis
of hard algorithmic problems. The multivariate approach allows more realistic modelling of
real-world input distributions. Research is conducted in:</p>
<li>
Foundational multivariate algorithmics; including for example, research into
interconnections with heuristics and approximations
</li>
<li>
Applications in analysing massive data sets, bioinformatics and biomedicine, artificial
intelligence, computational social choice, cognitive science, ecology, and other
disciplines
</li>
<h5>Mathematical Sciences Communication</h5>
<p>
Our research explores ways of sharing the frontiers of mathematical science and our
cutting-edge research, especially with children. Building on work in the “Computer Science
Unplugged!” project, the PCRU creates activities and materials with Both-Ways philosophy
to better establish, maintain and nurture math learning in remote Indigenous and all
communities.</p>
